Title: Caesar Cipher using Python

Description:

This project implements the Caesar cipher, a classic and simple encryption technique. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters a certain number of positions (the key) in the alphabet.

Features:

Encryption: Encode plaintext messages into ciphertext using the Caesar cipher.
Decryption: Decode ciphertext back to the original plaintext message.
User-friendly interface (optional, depending on your implementation).
